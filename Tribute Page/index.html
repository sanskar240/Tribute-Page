        <h1>Apple-The company</h1>
        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company
             headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops and
              sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services
               Apple was started in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.[7] Before
                they made the company, they sold "blue boxes", which had telephone
                 buttons on them. People could use them to make telephone calls from
                  payphones without paying any money. It did this by pretending to be
                   a telephone operator. The company's first product is now called the
                    Apple I computer. .</p>

        <h1>Family Life</h1>
        <img src="/download.jpg">
        <p>Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco,
             California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew up
              with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a
               hobby. Jobs remembers his father as being very skilled at working with 
               his hands. Steve Wozniak was working for the computer company Hewlett-Packard, 
               and the papers that said he could work there said he had to give everything he
                invented to the company before he could do what he wanted to do with it. 
                He showed the first Apple I to the boss at Hewlett-Packard, but they did not 
                want his computer. Wozniak was then free to do what he wanted to do with the Apple I. 
                It began selling in 1976. In 1977, they made their second computer, called the Apple II,
                 which later became very successful compared to Apple I.
